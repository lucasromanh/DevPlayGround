# DevPlayground - Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
DevPlayground is an interactive full-stack development environment designed for rapid prototyping and education. It allows users to manage Frontend, Backend, and Database structures in a single integrated interface.

## Core Modules & Features

### 1. Database Module (CRITICAL FOR TESTING)
- **Visual Designer**: An ER diagram canvas where users can drag and drop table cards.
- **Relationship Lines**: Visual connections between tables (Foreign Keys) that update dynamically.
- **SQL Console**: A simulated SQL engine supporting multi-statement execution (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP).
- **Data Explorer**: A tabular view to browse and edit row data directly.
- **DBML Integration**: Bi-directional sync between visual design and DBML code.

### 2. Backend Module
- **Endpoint Manager**: Definition of API routes (GET, POST).
- **Server Logs**: Real-time simulation of server activity and request handling.
- **Environment Variables**: Management of system-wide constants.

### 3. Frontend Module
- **Code Editor**: Real-time editor for HTML, CSS, and JS.
- **Live Preview**: An isolated iframe rendering the frontend code.

## User Persona
Developers and students looking to visualize system architecture and test SQL logic without local database overhead.

## Success Criteria for Testing
- Tables can be repositioned on the diagram without errors.
- SQL queries return valid JSON results in the terminal log.
- Changing DBML code correctly updates the visual table structure.
- Navigation between "Visual Designer" and "Data Explorer" is fluid.
